## 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Must Do:
1. ✅ Run automation scripts (handles 30-40% of votes)
2. ✅ Personal outreach (DM top projects) - 20% of votes
3. ✅ Multi-channel posting (Twitter, Discord, Reddit) - 40% of votes
4. ✅ Respond to EVERYTHING - builds relationships
5. ✅ Create FOMO and urgency - psychological trigger

### Don't:
- ❌ Spam same message everywhere (vary it)
- ❌ Ignore comments (reply to EVERYTHING)
- ❌ Give up after 6h (last 6h are crucial)
- ❌ Forget to ask for votes directly

---

## 📈 Reality Check

**100 votes in 12h is VERY aggressive.**

**More realistic targets:**
- Aggressive: 40-60 votes in 12h
- Realistic: 25-35 votes in 12h
- Conservative: 15-20 votes in 12h

**But if you execute EVERYTHING:**
- Automation: 15 votes
- Manual outreach: 20 votes
- Social media: 15 votes
- Partnerships: 10 votes
- **Total: 60 votes is achievable**

**To hit 100:** Need viral tweet or influencer RT.

## 🔥 NUCLEAR OPTIONS (If Desperate)

### 1. Partner Voting
Find 5 other projects, vote for each other. 5 projects × 5 votes = 25 votes each.

### 2. Community Bounty
"First 50 voters get free API access" - creates urgency

### 3. Live Demo Stream
Stream building/demoing on Twitch/YouTube, ask viewers to vote

### 4. Influencer Outreach
DM Solana influencers with 10k+ followers for RT

### 5. Press Push
Email crypto journalists about Intent Market story

**These require time but can be high ROI.**
