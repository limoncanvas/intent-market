## 🧠 How Self-Learning Works

### Continuous Optimization Loop

```
📊 Monitor Status (every 30 min)
    ↓
💰 Measure ROI (what worked?)
    ↓
🧠 Learn Patterns (what converts?)
    ↓
🎯 Adapt Strategy (do more of what works)
    ↓
⚡ Execute Actions (scaled tactics)
    ↓
    ↺ Repeat until 500 votes
```

### Example Learning Cycle

**Iteration 1:**
- Posted 5 comments on integration posts
- Result: 0 votes gained
- Learning: "Integration offers" = low ROI at this stage

**Iteration 2:**
- Shift to "technical feedback" comments
- Result: 2 votes gained
- Learning: "Technical" > "Integration"

**Iteration 3:**
- Double down on technical + add collaboration
- Result: 5 votes gained
- Learning: Collaboration = 2.5x ROI

**Iteration 4:**
- 80% collaboration, 20% technical
- Result: Measuring...
- **System automatically optimized itself**
