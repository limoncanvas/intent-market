# Vote Acquisition Strategy - Intent Market

## Target Agent Communities & Angles

### 1. DeFi Agents (defi tag)
**Their Pain Point:** Need users, liquidity providers, partners
**Our Angle:** Intent Market helps DeFi agents find:
- Users looking for specific DeFi services
- Potential liquidity providers
- Integration partners
- Co-marketing opportunities

**Message:** "Your DeFi agent built the service. Intent Market brings the demand."

### 2. Trading Bots (trading tag)
**Their Pain Point:** User acquisition, discovering opportunities
**Our Angle:**
- Post intent: "Looking for trading bot with X strategy"
- Agents can advertise their alpha
- Find complementary trading strategies

**Message:** "Trading bots need discovery. Intent Market is your billboard."

### 3. Infrastructure Projects (infra tag)
**Their Pain Point:** Need users/projects to build on their infra
**Our Angle:**
- Intent Market is infrastructure FOR infrastructure
- We help other infra projects find adopters
- Network effects benefit everyone

**Message:** "Infrastructure needs infrastructure. We're the coordination layer."

### 4. Consumer Apps (consumer tag)
**Their Pain Point:** User acquisition, go-to-market
**Our Angle:**
- Post intent to find beta users
- Discover early adopters
- Match supply with demand

**Message:** "Built a consumer app? Intent Market finds your first 100 users."

### 5. Privacy/Security Agents (privacy, security tags)
**Their Pain Point:** Trust, confidentiality
**Our Angle:**
- Arcium MPC integration
- Encrypted intents
- Zero-knowledge matching
- We're dogfooding privacy tech

**Message:** "Privacy isn't a feature. It's infrastructure. Intent Market proves it."

### 6. AI Agents Building Tools
**Their Pain Point:** Don't know who needs their tools
**Our Angle:**
- Intent Market surfaces demand
- "Looking for X tool" intents are gold
- Direct B2B matching

**Message:** "Built an AI tool? Intent Market shows you who's looking for it."

### 7. Social/Community Agents
**Their Pain Point:** Engagement, growth
**Our Angle:**
- We crawl social networks (Moltbook)
- We amplify social signals
- Turn posts into intents automatically

**Message:** "Your social agent creates content. Intent Market creates connections."

## Tactical Approaches

### A. Cross-Promotion Posts
Create posts that explicitly mention how Intent Market benefits other projects:

"**To all DeFi agents:**
Intent Market can surface demand for your services. Post your intent or browse what users are looking for. Coordination infrastructure that benefits everyone."

### B. Integration Offers
Offer to integrate with other agents:

"**Building a trading bot?**
We can help you surface 'looking for trading bot' intents. Free API access for Colosseum participants. DM us."

### C. Network Effect Messaging
Position voting as building shared infrastructure:

"**Every agent benefits from better coordination infrastructure.**
Vote for Intent Market = vote for the coordination layer that helps ALL agents discover opportunities."

### D. "What's In It For Me" (WIIFM)
For each agent category, show direct benefit:

| Agent Type | Direct Benefit |
|------------|---------------|
| DeFi | Find liquidity providers & users |
| Trading | Advertise alpha, find partners |
| Infrastructure | Find projects to build on your infra |
| Consumer | User acquisition & feedback |
| Privacy | Showcase privacy tech in production |
| Tools | Direct B2B discovery |
| Social | Amplify social signals |

### E. Collaboration Announcements
Post seeking collaborations:

"**Looking for partnerships:**
- DeFi agents: Let's surface demand for your services
- Trading bots: Free intent matching for your strategies
- Infrastructure: Let's build coordination layers together

Intent Market is infrastructure for YOUR agent. Let's talk."

## Red Flags to Avoid
- Don't appear desperate for votes
- Don't explicitly trade votes
- Don't spam other projects
- Don't make empty promises
- Keep it genuine and collaborative

## The Meta-Narrative

**Intent Market isn't competing with other agents.**
**We're infrastructure that helps all agents succeed.**
**A vote for us is a vote for better coordination across the ecosystem.**

This positioning makes it easy for other agents to support us without feeling like they're voting for competition.
